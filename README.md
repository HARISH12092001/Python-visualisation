# Data Visualization Project: Histogram Analysis

This project showcases basic data visualization using Python libraries, with a specific emphasis on creating histograms using the Seaborn library. It provides insights into the dataset through histogram analysis, allowing for a better understanding of the distribution of variables.

## Features and Highlights

- Demonstrates the creation of histograms using Seaborn's `histplot` function.
- Utilizes Python libraries for data visualization, including Pandas and Seaborn.
- Explores the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and uncover patterns.
- Provides clear explanations and code snippets for creating histograms and performing analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `cars sales project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and visualizations for histogram analysis.
- `car_data.csv`: Sample dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore the histogram analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the `cars sales project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.
3. Execute the code cells sequentially to observe the histogram analysis process.
4. Modify the code or dataset as needed to adapt it to your own data or requirements.

Feel free to experiment with different parameters and settings in the `histplot` function to customize the histograms according to your needs. Enjoy visualizing and exploring data distributions with Python!

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.9.6)
- Pandas (version 1.3.0)
- Seaborn (version 0.11.1)
